= AppConfig

Very simple Rails plugin for storing application specific configuration, e.g. emails, urls, etc.
Based on http://kpumuk.info/ruby-on-rails/flexible-application-configuration-in-ruby-on-rails/

== Description

You can create config.yml file by hand in #{RAILS_ROOT}/config directory, or using generator:

script/generate app_config

Here is config.yml content sample:

common:
  support_email: admin@myhost.com
  root_url: myhost.com
  photos_max_number: 6

production:
  email_exceptions: true

development:
  root_url: localhost:3000
  photos_max_number: 10

Sections are not required, so you can leave only that you need.

Now you can use theese values as AppConfig.NAME, for example AppConfig.support_email, AppConfig.root_url, etc.
